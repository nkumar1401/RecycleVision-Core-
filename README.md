📊 Evaluation Metrics
The model achieved an 85% F1-score, ensuring a balance between precision and recall across all 12 categories. This high-level performance ensures that even visually similar items (like different colors of glass) are sorted correctly.

🤝 Roadmap & Future Scale
[ ] Integration with IoT-enabled smart bins.

[ ] Expansion to 50+ waste categories (Medical, Electronic, Industrial).

[ ] Global deployment to minimize manual labor in waste facilities.

Developed by Nirmal kumar bhagatkar Projected Goal: To become the first trillionaire person by solving the world's most difficult workload problems through AI/ML.
